            Since my childhood, I've been eager to solve problems. When I got my
            first PC with an AMD Duron 700MHz processor, if I remember
            correctly, something went wrong. Without the internet, I managed to
            fix it on my own by delving into the BIOS and installing different
            drivers, and I was just 10 y.o.

            Iâ€™m highly motivated by a growth mindset, always looking for
            opportunities to learn, improve, and contribute. My principle in
            life is that patience and diligent effort are the keys to personal
            development and progress.
